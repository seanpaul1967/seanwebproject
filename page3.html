    2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
    your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
    Trello : the overall use of the IT tools i have been using within certain tasks and projects
    i have been assigned have been very helpful while performing back end development
    in visual studio code using python i learnt quite a lot as in the simplicity of the python code
    and syntax used to create a whole range of useful things that are commonly used in evry day
    life for e.g. atm machines, ticket machines , and so on and then when we switched up to
    using front end development techniques (HTML, CSS) for creating our own website
    i saw a whole new technique working to create a more user friendly website with graphics
    and images to appease the eye overall both concepts are crucial as a whole when creating digital projects. Visual code l thought was very simple to navigate and helped me a lot while learning new techniques for creating my business portfolio i found Trello to be an
    important tool in designing my website as i could go back and revisit where i needed to be and look at my ideas and see where i needed to be with regards to my own project 
</p>

<p>• 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
    Trello: I definitely think Visual Studio Code was appropriate to use for creating my website
    with the easy way to navigate and also to create two open editors at the same time to use html ,and Css while creating new pages led to me easily trouble shooting my code and making sure it worked on my actual portfolio which helped a lot Trello was crucial for me to
    go back and cross reference where my project was and if i was behind on my project i was able to see where i could catch up or what i had missed out on it helped me keep organised
    and in check which is crucial for any project that we take on Trello is a great virtual pin board
    and i would use over and over again 
</P>

<P> 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
    your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the
    interests of openness. What would you change?: Overall i would say that im very happy with
    my business portfolio that i created as i had a chance to actually put into practice the skills that i have picked up over this 3 week course i came from knowing absolutely nothing
    when it came to coding or developing a website to creating code to write a text based adventure game to actually researching and creating my own personal business portfolio
    i feel i have got stronger over the weeks and have learnt to embed pdf files.To embeding
    my text based game to showcase my skills that ive learned on this course there a few things that maybe i would change to create a more polished website but it requires learning some more skills for eg how to create rotating images and more complex buttons</P>
    <p> 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project :
    for further improvement i would like to implement on my business portfolio
    a feedback page along with more pages promoting previous work or hyperlinks to
    clients webpages i have designed for them also id like to make my website more
    user friendly and create a more rounded project from start to finish also would
    like to make it more interactive
 </p>

 <p>

    2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
    after reviewing my outcomes and looking at my digital project i have had to make sure 
    that firstly i was using the best IT tools that enabled me to make my project run as smooth 
    as possible i also had to ensure that i was using the proper techniques that i was taught i also 
    was very aware of making sure that my website was made so that it was user friendly and what i mean by that was that it was important to create this website with different operating 
    systems in mind and browser types so that i didnt lose half my target audience also understanding the demographic nature of my project to ensure its easy to navigate and 
    simplicity was important i had to take into consideration the different networks where
    users would be connecting to my website for instance if they were using 3G ,4G or 
    wifi overall   i also took into cosideration when adding external links to othersites that i did
    not lose the traffic by sending them away from webpage and when they close that browser down they didnt come back to my website so these are all steps that i took to make project fit for purpose 

 </p>


<p>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
    productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your
    website? How? Could you have done it in teams? the benefits of IT tools and systems that i have used in my project are this Visual Studio Code for me was easy to navigate and allowed me to have two open editors at a time so i could easily look at both my HTML , and CSS
    code when writing in to check for any mistakes or troubleshoot any wrong written code
    also i found it very easy to drag and drop my images into VSC to allow me to add these to my project that i was designing i also found using live server to go direct to my online project to see changes that i implemented and if it was a success or not the benefits of slack and zoom and google meets is these platforms allow us to communicate with others and leave
    feedback or help out with problems that have arisen throughout our projects so overall id say these provided me with an effective and efficient way to go about creating my project
    the only drawbacks i came across where sometimes i found there was a way to get distracted with slack i think we could achieve this project in a team as with extra peoples opinions and ideas would help solve any issues and as the saying goes two pairs of hands is better than one
 </p>

<p>• 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency the ways i would improve productivity and efficiency would be to schedule throughout my working day to have rest breaks where i take time away from my project to ensure that i clear my mind also have regular checks to my trello board to ensure im completing tasks in specific time frames
    also goal setting throughout my project whether it be daily goals hourly goals and weekly goals to compliment what ive set out to do all of these methods can boost productivity it is also very important to ensure you are having a good nights rest to maximise your day to day productivity and make sure you are efficient in every task you take on but overall its important to stay consistent to what you set out to do
</p> 

<p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
    would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? the solutions i would
    develop to improve my own productivity using IT in digital products would be to bring in teammates no matter how near or far by using communication software such as slack ,
    google meets, zoom ,there is also chanty aswell as flock and other useful messaging and social media platforms out you can also stay organized all across workflows with cloud based project or task management software such as github so that everything you work on is stored somewhere to let you easily access it even if your laptop crashes or you cant access
    files. Again we can make every second count by using tracking tools such as timeboy and simply by creating some fun stuff into your workplace or project which helps boost morale and overall productivity i think if i was to do this again id definitely work with a team and boost productivity and have even more fun 
</p>

<p>
    • 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions the way we would go about testing digital solutions is understanding the challenges we face when creating a website for example which browsers and devices we use to prove our website is accessible .we have to remeber that when creating websites its important that cutomers can use the website with
    specific devices and browser types and operating systems we must take into consideration
    that the end user may not be able to use or access the website as intended so to combat this i would research the target market and audience and think what devices they would be likely to use also take into to consideration the country they are accessing the website from and the demographics of who is likely to use the website and what devices they are likely to use
    while all of this is equally important we have to understand where the majority of the risk is
    and look to counter this by testing on the most common platforms there are several other issues to consider like pop ups and overlays just to name a few it is also import to look out for bugs and to test our website to see how it reacts on different networks for example 3G
    4G or wifi its always beneficial to stay in touch with market trends and new versions of browsers and their usability
