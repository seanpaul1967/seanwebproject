    1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business  the purpose of information technology in modern day business is neccessary
    more than ever as most modern businesses use it in every day use from computers to
    store customers information to the critical use of equipment in hospitals without
    information technology there would be no use of simple little things such as a heart monitor
    to more advanced Mri machines or even telephones so overall information technology is
    all around us in every day life "IT plays a number of vital roles in organisations in improving communication inventory management, decision making , data
    management as well as customer relationship management " https://www.1training.org "information technology has improved customer support customers can receive support from multiple channels telephone emails, social media platforms , webinars and so on .additionally , customer relationship management systems help businesses understand customer behaviour" https://www.business2community.com

<P> 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
    successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What
    skills? : there are several methods and skills involved in completing a digital project
    ranging from starting to plan the project with the use of a virtual pin board with the likes
    of Trello where u assign tasks to be done for the said project and create a to do list so that
    at any point throughout the project you can then go back to the plan and see where you are
    at what needs done and how you structured this plan in the first instance you then go onto writing the code for this digital project in programmes such as python (which is back end development software) at the beginning of each day you can hold stand ups with team members on this project by using google meets zoom or other video conferencing platforms
    to check in and problem solve any problems that have arisen
</p>

<p>

    1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
    Include a link to your Trello board. :the plan for my website is to create a portfolio where i can exhibit all
    my experience that i have gained throughout this course for example i will be using
    a Trello board to organise my structured approach to developing my own business portfolio
    displaying my own digital projects that i have been working on along with tips and tricks that
    i found useful along the way and explain in detail how i went about setting this up
    
    N.B here is a link to my Trello board Sean  https://trello.com/b/r5jNmlUx/sean-mckay-own-portfolio

    1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
    projects to fail? Why? :there are several risks that can impact your digital project
    from not planning properly the old saying of fail to prepare prepare to fail springs to mind
    not being organized and giving yourself enough time to complete tasks not keeping your
    visual pin board (TRELLO) up to date not being engaged enough and not seeing
    the task through or not sticking to your original plan are all ways that your digital task can fail if you need help and dont ask for it can see you fail (honesty is the best policy) also communication is a massive thing in any industry and especially on digital projects</p>
 </P>

 <p>
    
    1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
    how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?: there are lots of options to choose from in information technology
    for specific tasks and jobs so for instance if i wanted to create a website
    i would be using html and css to design and create a specific user friendly website with lovely
    interfaces and buttons and pictures with graphics attached this is known as front end developement but if i was using a website to purchase a pair of football boots for instance
    and entered in my personal information for them to be delivered to my home address this is where the really cool backend developer comes in using a programme like python
    it stores this critical info and when i go back to check on my delivery status it uses my info
    to let me know my order status
    where front end developers and back end developers sometimes work in tandem
    along sidde each other they are performing completely seperate tasks the way i explain it is this
    sometimes you walk past a building site and all you see is boards around the site but hear workers working away (backend developers ) they are laying a very strong foundation so that
    the buliding doesnt fall down then next time you walk past its got a massive structure and nearly complete (front end developer) now you see a whole complete picture where the house looks nice and ready to use this analogy is like creating graphics and using buttons and pictures and colours to your website front end what the eye can see and use</P>

    1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
    achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and
    GitHub help with your codes version control: For the last two weeks ive been using slack,python,zoom,google meet and the past week ive been using
    a trello board to help me organise my online digital project to help accomplish tasks that i had been set and to learn new forms of coding my overall analysis of python is that is very smooth to use and easy to navigate through commands slack is a great method to chat
    with fellow team members and to post general stuff in and keep in touch with likeminded
    people trello is a very useful tool to use in any project you do as it gives you the chance
    to go back and look at the structured plan you created and lets you organise where you need to be in line with your projects from my understanding GITHUB its a web based platform used for version control to simplify working with other people and collaborate on projects "GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration . it lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere ." https://guides.github.com "Github is a
    highly used software that is typically used for version control it is helpufull
    when more than just one person is working on a project for example , a software developer wants to build a website and everyone has to update their
    code simultaneously while working on their project . in this case ,GitHub
    helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload ,edit
    and manage the code files" https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-to-use-github/
    as a unit </p>

    1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
    GDPR impact digital projects? :there are certain legal Guidlines that we must be aware of when producing digital projects for instance we must be aware of the copyright laws and procedures if we are using
    any form of material that has been protected under copyright law for an online digital project we must seek permission first to use it otherwise we leave ourselves open to
    legal proceedings "when making a website or social media all websites should carry your Compnays registered address and company (or charity) registration number . consider including usage terms and conditions and disclaimer for your website : sample website usage terms and conditions
    sample website disclaimer
    you should be aware of legal implications and best practice when using social media " https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/legal-considerations-digital-marketing most significant constraints on projects are ,
    cost ,do we have enough money to complete if it costs
    and schedule (time) can we complete this in the specified time that was set out and
    within the budget it was set in
    there is a third which is scope but i found that out using google GDPR can
    create a problem while doing digital projects as you need to be aware of what happens to
    personal information and where that data is stored and who has access of that and we cannot use info to then contact the personal information either "GDPR gives data subjects , such as users online services, a greater degree of control over the processing of their data - it broadens the scope of their rights ,giving them better insight into exactly how much information is stored about them , how it is used , and allowing them to restrict or even completely stop" https://www.monterail.com
