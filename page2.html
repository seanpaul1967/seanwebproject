     1.1 Describe  the content and layout for each page: The way i have set up the content 
on my page is for easy navigation i have set up an index page creating several pages that have information and displaying what  skills i learned from this three week course my  about me page is where i have kept a short intro about my work history and experience and how i  have came to get onto this course i created a background image from my pictures from thailand when i was travelling there  i used this image to create a personal touch to my website   i have also added a work experience  page where i embeded a text based adventure game (RPG) onto this page which i learned using backend developement on software called Visual Studio Code writing python code i was part of a team in this project also on here i embeded pdf files of my teams presentation too for easy access  on page 1 i have answered several questions that i was set within our course work i added some color  font to my text to make it  stand out and created background border using rgba()    so that my red font stands out against a black border page 2 is more answers to the course work where the same technique was used with the text and font colors and background page 3 
has the rest of the answers to questions that we had been set with the same procedure as previous pages i have also include a travel page where i have included images of when i have been travelling with friends or on my own i used visual code to implement my pictures on there and create a little gallery of holidays and the very last page i have created a get in touch page where i have created several methods for future employers or clients to get in contact with me i also included a hire me button which is completeing my page and demonstrating all the techniques , skills that i have learned while on this 3 week course with 
codenation

    1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints afecting websites:"they originate new work they own the copyright and they can specify how their work can be used by licensing it. They can also assign the copyright to someone else. This is the case with the INGOT community resources site. candidates assign copyright to The Learning Machine who then license it for sharing. If each person licensed their work in different ways it would make it almost impossible to re-use any of the material because anyone doing so would have to try and trace the originator and ask permission or at least find the license conditions. By transferring copyright to one entity it is far easier to give permission to reuse content through a single license and all materials on the INGOT community resource site is intended to be licensed Creative Commons Share Alike. Any work that is not original should be referenced, not just because plagiarism is grounds for disqualification in gaining qualifications but also because the owner can sue the person using their work without permission.
    Fair use means that short extracts can be used from acknowledged work.
</p>
    
<p>


 digital age has made copyright and publishing very "hot" topics because it is so easy to copy digital information without loss of quality. Candidates need to check all content they use to make sure the appropriate permissions are in place and that work other than their own is properly referenced. One of the big advantages of using Open Source software is that the risk of inadvertently breaking the law is much reduced since you are encouraged to share the work. For this reason copyright licensing that is designed to encourage sharing is sometimes referred to as copyleft. </p>
</p>
 



<p>Copyleft work is licensed so that if you re-use it by adding to it, the subsequent work also has to be licensed in the same way. The intention is that the benefits of sharing are then passed on to subsequent work built on the original. The GNU/Linux operating system and associated applications are a good example of copyleft in action as is Wikipedia for content. In summary, candidates should NOT have any copyright material in their pages that is not licensed to share or originated by themselves. They should demonstrate a clear understanding of what is and is not legal to use based on its license.
    
    Other constraints are the need to interoperate with other people so all content should conform to open standards. Avoid having proprietary files such as .ppt or .pub for download. For usability ensure colours have sufficient contrast to be viewable by colour blind people and that there are text descriptions with graphics for accessibility by blind people."

    1.6 Describe  access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
    people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome
    them : websites should employ open standards that are universally supported across as many
    web browsers as possible .they should understand the need for putting alternative text
    with graphics for the sight -impaired and that the choice of colours is important ".
    they should realise that if a web page only displays in one browser ,no matter how popular
    , they are cutting out part of the potential audience for their work .they should avoid using proprietary data files for making the data available for download . the safest files to use
    are those that have ISO standards associate with them .Partially sighted people
    might not be able to see graphic images and so when inserting a graphic always put
    in the alternative text . there are programs that can read this text to tell a blind person
    about the images ,provide a text based alternative .be careful with colours ,particularly
    for text.Generally ,theme colours will be chosen to give sufficient contrast or differences
    so they can be seen by colour blind people .At this level the most important issues are to make the site compliant with standards and suitable for the sight impaired there are many other issues and more can be learnt at http://www-03.ibm.com/able/access_ibmdisability.html and also http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/abdesign.html

    1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites: these are the file types that are appropriate types as open standards
    related to the web. HTML, .txt, pdf, .jpg, .png, .svg .mp3 (note .mp3 is an ISO standard
    but there a number of patent issues associated with it worth mentioning .ogg as an up and coming fully open alternative ). There are too many possible file types to include each in detail . why are we not including .doc , .xls .ppt? while these formats are very widely
    used they are often misused take a training session where a presentation is used to convey information to an audience of 100 people .in most cases this presentation will be a simple slide
    set in powerpoint and it will make no use of powerpoint,s more advanced features .
</p>


<p> Distrubuting the file to delegates means each one has to manage that file individually and in practice the files will probably be lost .Furthermore if the information in the presentation can be referenced to other information the use of a desktop file based program makes this much less likely . Any update to the information presented in a web page is immediately shared with everyone We want learners to think more critically (PLTS)about how they use information rather than simply choosing an application that happens to be popular
    a presentation could be simply a set of linked web pages to provide that to the audience
    simply means making the URL available the information can be linked to any other information all that is needed to access it is a web browser eg on a smartphone no need
    to buy any expensive software or have a more powerful computer if greater organisation of slides is needed there are free on-line presentation applications such as google docs which can exchange presentations with powerpoint if there is no internet connection available
    make the presentation in google docs for sharing ,export to powerpoint or openoffice
    impress for giving the presentation away from the internet this of course requires different
    ways of working which is difficult for older people but the trend is to move to the web so
    for young people they will find an increasing range of free software tools on the internet to
    support this type of work we are focussing on the open formats because in terms of transfer
    of technological skills and knowledge they have specific importance they enable wider
    sharing of information with greater inclusion and there is a global trend to open standards
    learners should be discouraged from attaching files to pages when the information can easily be presented in the page itself while a word processor or desktop publisher will enable more
    sophisticated layout options and producing pdf files will preserve these it is quicker and cleaner to just present the information in a standard web page perhaps with the option to produce pdf if needed. it is better for the Enviroment to reduce printing paper not for viewing on a screen. Most information on web sites is simply viewed , especially by the younger generation , let's not encourage the use of file formats designed for paper when
    paper is generally unnecessary .

</P>
    
<p>

    we can produce pdf files from web pages in any case if it really is necessary to put the content on paper.Candidates should always consider the purpose and audience of their work (PLTS) they should understand that attaching files in proprietary formats is considered by some people to be anti social because it is saying to users that if they dont have or cant afford some particular software application they cant access the information.Here is an element related to inclusion and equality of opportunity.
    Although some proprietary format providers will provide readers free of charge there is always a future possibility that once a monopoly is established they could change there possibility that once a monopoly is established they could change their policy .it is
    therefore much safer in the long term to support fully open standards where they exist and the trend in the industry is to do so as applications mature .
    an example of a typical "grey" area is audio . thomson consumer electronics and the fraunhofer society both claim patents related to .mp3 files although no royalty is currently collected simply for using the format, fraunhofer were cited as making 100 million euros
    from companies making mp3 players (all of which of course is passed on to consumers )
    .ogg files are a similar technology but fully open . more players are being produced that
    can play .ogg files because there is no royalty to pay and even if .ogg never becomes as popular as .mp3 it serves a valuable purpose because it makes it very unlikely that the owners of .mp3 could successfully levy further charges eg for the use of .mp3 currently the confusing range of video formats presents similar problems .each company is trying to establish a monopoly by making its format the standard . if any were to succeed they could charge every time anyone watches any film or video clip .fortunately the presence of open standards such as .mpeg and no absolutely dominant player results in an impasse where in nearly all cases video playback software is free of charge and is often cross-platform.
    in short, having an open standard breaks the monopoly helping keep costs down and development standards high by promoting competition .Candidates should be able to describe text, graphics , audio and video formats suitable for use on the web and appreciate
    the basic problems of proprietary formats and monopolies"
