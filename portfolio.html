 <p>

in the trinket up above is a game i designed with a software program called
python its a text based game or also known as RPG where i learned back end developement 
from writing the code to actually planning out the game from the start to the 
end i broke it down to small pieces and split it up into 4 parts to tackle one at a time 
i also done trouble shooting along the way to overcome problems 
that arose in the game code and how to incorporate  the python skills 
that i learned along the way into an interactive game 
i created a presentation with my team members who worked alongside 
me to explain how we set about creating this from scratch 
and we then looked back to see how we managed this digital project 
and if we could have improved it and what we could of done different i have embedded a pdf above 
of my presentation
